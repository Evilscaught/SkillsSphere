# SkillsSphere (BETA PROGRAM)
We are a community-focused platform that aims to give back to those who are a little more introverted but want to gain real-life work experience. What better way to do this than by creating a sphere of members who can come together and help one another while earning some money?

## How it Works

### Step 1: Sign up for the Code Lotto
 **Join our program for just $5/month.**

### Step 2: Get picked for a project
**We'll draw numbers all month long, as long as we have work available. If you're picked, you'll get your $5 back plus a commission for your work (percentage based on past work).**

### Step 3: Complete the project
**Work on the assigned project and submit your code for review.**

### Step 4: Get paid
**Earn a profit based on your work.**
